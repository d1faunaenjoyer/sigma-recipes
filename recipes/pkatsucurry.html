    <p>You see this in every asian restaurant, and it's pretty nice. But some places charge too much for what is quite a simple dish.</p>
    <p>This recipe can be easily made at home with not a lot of ingredients and not a lot of money.</p>

    <h2>Notes:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are Muslim, you can still make this. Use chicken breasts or thighs.</li>
        <li>This recipe will include some fresh vegetables to act as a bit of a palette clenser. If you're a veggie hater, sure. Don't include the veggies, but I will judge you heavily.</li>
      </ul>
